        <h1>Bitwise Koch Curve Visualiser</h1>
        <p>
            The Koch curve is a classic example of a fractal curve, created by recursively altering a straight line segment.
            This visualiser allows you to explore the fascinating properties of the Koch curve by adjusting the number of iterations.

        <h2>About the Koch Curve</h2>
        <p>
            The Koch curve starts with a straight line segment. In each iteration, every line segment is divided into three equal parts,
            and the middle segment is replaced with two segments that form an equilateral "bump". This process is repeated for each line segment,
            resulting in a complex, infinitely detailed curve.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Koch curve has several interesting properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.</li>
            <li>Its length increases by a factor of 4/3 with each iteration.</li>
            <li>It has a fractal dimension of approximately 1.2619.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Use the controls below to adjust the number of iterations and see how the Koch curve evolves!

        <h2>Bitwise Parity Calculation</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to visualising the Koch curve, this application also demonstrates a bitwise parity calculation.
            Bitwise operations are fundamental in computer science and are used in various applications, including error detection and correction.
            The parity of a number indicates whether the count of set bits (1s) is odd or even.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bitwise parity is calculated using the XOR operation, which efficiently determines the parity by combining bits.
            This method can be used to calculate the Koch curve iterations by determining the parity of the iteration count, and applying 
            specific transformations based on whether the count is odd or even.
